<h1>Welcome to Inbucket</h1>

<p>Inbucket is an email testing service; it will accept email for any email
address and make it available to view without a password.</p>

<p>To view messages for a particular address, enter the username portion
of the address into the box on the upper right and click <em>View</em>.</p>

<p>This instance of Inbucket is running inside of a <a
  href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> container.  It is
configured to retain messages for a maximum of 3 days, and will enforce a limit
of 300 messages per mailbox - the oldest messages will be deleted to stay under
that limit.</p>

<p>Messages addressed to any recipient in the <code>@bitbucket.local</code>
domain will be accepted but not written to disk.  Use this domain for load or
soak testing your application.</p>
